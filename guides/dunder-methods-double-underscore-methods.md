# Dunder Methods(Double Underscore Methods)

Dunder methods, short for "double underscore" methods but often referred to as "magic methods" or "special methods," are special functions in Python that have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names, like `__init__` or `__str__`. These methods have specific meanings and purposes in Python, and they allow you to define how objects of your custom classes behave in various situations.

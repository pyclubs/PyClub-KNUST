# User Input

### User Input

Python allows for user input.

That means we are able to ask the user for input.

Python uses the `input()` method.

```
// Example code
username = input("Enter username:")
print("Username is: " + username)
```

Python stops executing when it comes to the `input()` function, and continues when the user has given some input.

# Class Methods and Properties

Class methods and properties are essential components of object-oriented programming in Python. They allow you to define methods and attributes that are associated with a class itself rather than with its instances (objects). This can be useful for managing class-level data and behavior. Here's an explanation of class methods and properties:

&#x20;

**Class Methods:**

A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the instance of the class. You define a class method using the `` `@classmethod` `` decorator. It takes the class itself as its first argument, which is typically named `` `cls` `` by convention.

```python
class MyClass:
    class_variable = 0  # A class-level variable
   
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
   
    @classmethod
    def increment_class_variable(cls, amount):
        cls.class_variable += amount
```

\# Using the class method



```python
obj1 = MyClass(1)
obj2 = MyClass(2)
 
print(MyClass.class_variable)  # Output: 0
MyClass.increment_class_variable(5)
print(MyClass.class_variable)  # Output: 5   
```

In this example, \``increment_class_variable`\` is a class method that modifies the class-level variable \``` class_variable` ``. You can call this method on the class itself (\`MyClass\`) rather than on instances (\`obj1\` or \`obj2\`).

**Class Properties:**

A class property is an attribute that is associated with the class and not with instances of the class. You can define class properties using the \`@property\` decorator. These properties can be accessed like regular attributes but are computed using special methods.

```python
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius
   
    @property
    def diameter(self):
        return 2 * self.radius
   
    @property
    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius  2
 
circle = Circle(5)
print(circle.radius)   # Output: 5
print(circle.diameter) # Output: 10
print(circle.area)     # Output: 78.5
```

&#x20;

In this example, \`diameter\` and \`area\` are class properties that provide computed values based on the \`radius\` attribute. When you access these properties, they are calculated on-the-fly using the defined methods.

&#x20;

Class methods and properties are valuable tools for managing class-level behaviour and data. They are particularly useful when you need to work with data that is shared among all instances of a class or when you want to provide computed attributes for your classes.
